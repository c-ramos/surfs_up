# Surfs Up Challenge
Utilized SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to connect to and query a SQLite database.

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

Before opening a surf and ice cream shop, an investor wants more information about temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. By completing an analysis of the trends, the investor can determine if the business can operate sustainably year-round. 

## Results:
- The average recorded temperature for June is about 75 degrees, which is 4 degrees higher than December at about 71 degrees.
- The min and max temperatures for December have a larger range than those in June.
- The frequency of temperatures recorded in June is higher than the December temperatures.

## Summary:
The findings suggest that the temperatures in December would still provide appropriate conditions for both surfing and demand in ice cream. The average temperatures in June and December differ by about 4 degrees. The mean temperature for December is about 71 degrees and almost 75 degrees for June. It would be helpful to explore other variables, like past wind conditions and low and high tides.
